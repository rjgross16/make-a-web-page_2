            You are on a browser (hopefully, or else then I have no answer for you). You told your browser to go to this page, and so your computer, since it's dumb and has no mind of its own (yet), went ahead and texted its friend Web and said "Hey buddy, can you send me the files that my owner requested?"
            <br>
            <br>
            Web said, "no problem, just give me a few nanoseconds," then retreived the files from a server via something called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP</a> and sent them to your computer. Then your browser, since it's also dumb and has no mind of its own, interpeted the files that came through and displayed them on your screen.

            I used a language called HTML, which stands for Hypertext Markup Language. HTML is made up of:
          </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Text content - which is what you are seeing now</li>
                <li>Markup - which is what this page looks like</li>
                <li>References to other documents - like the logo at the top of the screen/li>
                <li>Links to other pages - like this link to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riQTu_939MY">puppy video</a></li>
              </ul>

              How did you make it look like this?

        </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            Everything you see on the screen is part of an <strong>HTML element</strong>. You add these elements to your page using things called tags, and you can apply attributes, or <strong>styles</strong>, to those elements. So, for example, I added a link to the puppy video using a link tag (which looks like this: &lt;a&gt;), and I wrote in my code that all link elements should be my favorite shade of red and have bold font.

              Well, it would be really easy if computers weren't so dumb. I know what you're thinking, <em>Computers aren't dumb, didn't a computer beat Ken Jennings in Jeopardy?</em> That is true, but that computer was super dumb before programmers wrote a LOT of code to make it smart. And programmers must be careful when writing code. One small mistake, and the computer's <strong>stupidity</strong> would cause it to misinterpret the language and break everything.

            Oh, so how do your write HTML?
          </p>
        </div>
          <div class="concept-description">
            <p>
              To start, you can learn one easy thing, which is that every HTML document has the same basic structure:
            </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>HTML &lt;html&gt; - which tells the computer that you are writing a document using HTML</li>
                  <li>Head &lt;head&gt; - where you usually put the styling of your page</li>
                  <li>Body &lt;body&gt; - where pretty much everything else goes</li>
                </ul>
      	</div>
	    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">
        <p>
          So now you're saying it <em>is</em> easy?
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
          Well, to start is easy. But then what? You need to know some more essentials. For instance, there are other languages besides HTML. One language that's used for pretty much every web site is CSS. HTML controls the "structure" of a webpage, while CSS controls the "style" of the page.
          <br>
          <br>
          You can put your styling directly in to your HTML, but CSS is essential to code writers because it helps them avoid a lot of repetition. I already gave an example of this above. To avoid having to tell my HTML every time that I wanted my links red, I instead only had to type it once in my CSS.
        </p>
	     </div>
    </div>
	    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">
        <p>
          Tell me more about HTML and CSS
        </p>
      </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
           <p>
              As I said, the &lt;head&gt; section is usually where you put styling, so if you have a CSS file you can simply put a link to it in the &lt;head&gt; section of your HTML and voila, your HTML will now listen to what your CSS tells it to do.<br>
              <br>
              Programmers use a "tree-like structure" when coding their sites. We call it that because HTML elements can have other elements inside of them, kind of like a family tree. And just like a family, the "child" elements can "inherit" attributes from a "parent", which, again, helps programmers avoid repetition.

          But what about these boxes?
        </p>
      </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            You're catching on already! You can see that there are boxes on this page. But even when you can't see boxes on the screen, know that the page was still built using boxes. Every page has boxes! Every box on your screen is built of four elements:
          </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Content - in the middle, contains the text and images you see on the screen. The other layers are like protection to the content.</li>
                <li>Padding - this clears an area around the content. Like how there is a little space between the red text and the gray side of your screen.</li>
                <li>Border - this goes around the content and padding. These boxes have a gray border on the bottom.</li>
                <li>Margin - the outermost layer, it provides spaces between the boxes on the page.</li>
              </ul>
        </div>
      </div>
    	<div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">
        <p>
          How do you get the boxes where you want them to go?
        </p>
      </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            Box sizing and positioning is one of the hardest parts of building a web page. You can set the size of your box with pixels, or in percentages. I used percentages on this page.

          Can you show me?
        </p>
      </div>
        <div class="concept-description">
          <p>
            You can see my code without me even showing you. Right click anywhere on this page, and if you're using Chrome as your browser, click "Inspect Element". ALl the coding that I wrote will be down there, and you can make adjustments to see what it would look like on the screen. This is a great tool for developers to play around with their coding in the browser before actually coding it.
